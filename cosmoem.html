                <p>Cosmoem is a Pokémon in the shape of a translucent, dark blue orb with a starscape pattern set in a golden shell-like structure. The main portion of the shell is a flat oval around the center of the orb. Eight more flat, half-oval projections surround the orb in an asterisk-shape. At the center of the main body is a much smaller black core. The upper half of the core has a thin blue line on the front, back, and each side, while the lower has pink lines. On the front are two orange semicircles, which appear to be closed eyes. The overall shape of this Pokémon also resembles an eye.</p>
                <p>Encased in its sturdy, cocoon-like shell, Cosmoem is unable to move. In Pokémon Refresh, it cannot even eat. It grows as it absorbs starlight and the dust in the air. Its body is warm to the touch. Cosmoem's shell is said to be harder than any known material. In ancient times, it was worshipped as the "cocoon of the stars" by the people of Alola.</p>
                <p>Cosmoem is one of the smallest Pokémon tying with Joltik, Flabébé, Cutiefly, and Comfey. Despite this, it is also the heaviest Pokémon, being tied with Celesteela.</p>
